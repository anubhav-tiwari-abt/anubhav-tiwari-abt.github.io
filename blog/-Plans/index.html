        <p id="para_0_original">With the start of 2022, I'm leaving behind the rut of last 2 years (2020 and 2021).<br />
          The lockdowns and job hunts really brought down my morale a lot and I felt <br />
          like I've been stuck in a rut with my skills becoming stale and that I haven't been learning anything new, <br />
          so with the start of 2022, I've decided to take up the skills that I feel are important and that I'm lagging behind on and work on them.
        </p>
        <p id="para_1_original">
          C++ was my first programming language to which I was introduced to in school, <br />
          but I didn't really create anything amazing or even a decent level individual project in C++.<br />
          I've always liked the language, but my move from C++ to JavaScript and then to Python, <br />
          took me away from the core of strongly typed and closer to the metal languages. <br />
          During my career till now, I've faced situations where I felt like if I knew C++ a little better, <br />
          I'd be more up to the standards, thus, I've decided to start from scratch on C++, <br />
          going from beginner to advanced modern C++ and finally developing a project in C++.
        </p>
        <p id="para_2_original">
          Another skill where I found myself struggling was SQL. I mean, I know SQL, but being unable to clear 3 interviews because of SQL skill requirement, I think it's better to start working on my SQL skills before I fail another interview.
        </p>
        <p id="para_3_original">
          I was also unable to focus on my personal project because of several factors, and my GitHub profile was looking more full of unfinished projects and stale and abandoned projects, so I decided to go clean slate on that as well. I've some amazing new projects in mind and I wanted to start fresh on them on a fresh GitHub profile.
        </p>
        <p id="para_4_original">
          I tried to create a branding of an organization of myself last year, but, what started with full excitement and aspirations, ended up being nothing more than that, a branding. I'm planning to things differently this year, make something first, brand and publish it later.
        </p>
        <p id="para_5_original">
          Another major thing that I've been putting off for about 3 years now is a research publication, It isn't that easy, and I've in past found ways to put it on the shelf and not work on it, but I'm planning At least 1 research paper out of this year on one of my research interests.
        </p>
        <p id="">
          So there we have it. New years (2022) plansÂ :
          <ol>
            <li>Master and Make a project in C++(17+)</li>
            <li>Master SQL</li>
            <li>Create and Publish open source projects (At least 1 major release) on new GitHub profile.</li>
            <li>Create a brand of yourself with everything above as a showcase.</li>
            <li>At least one research paper.</li>
          </ol><br />
          Will do a year in review next year and frequent updates on each of the above 5 goals.
